Every generation is told by the elders that the good old days were the best. But right from the days after the industrialisation and urbanisation, rampant imitation or adulteration of everything is heard of more often by the younger people. Whether it is finished goods or eatables, there is sub-standard stuff everywhere. Established brands of toothpastes, soaps, creams, blades and even medicines have imitations. In milk, spices, edible oils, tea leaves and flour there is adulteration. The result is that people suffer from many diseases and disorders. Even doctors can not save us, as the medicines and injections are also imitations.
